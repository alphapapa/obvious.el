#+TITLE: obvious.el

/Who needs comments when the code is so obvious./

* Installation

Add =obvious.el= to your ~load-path~, then ~(require 'obvious)~ and enable ~obvious-mode~.

* Usage

When the comments are getting to you, activate ~obvious-mode~.  If you don't even want to see header comments, customize the option ~obvious-headers~.

*Note:* For now, the mode should be disabled when writing a comment.
